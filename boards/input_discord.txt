Hi all, I am trying to get the LVGL display demos (including touch) running on
an imxRT1176. I connected a RK055HDMIPI4MA0 display kit and activated the
RK055HDMIPI4MA0 shield in Zephyr. The display is working fine and I can also
see touch events with the input_dump sample. But I run into issues when testing
demos that use display and touch simultaneously.

The draw_touch_events sample behaves in the following way:
- boots normally
- crashes when I test the touch screen during the approx 1st minute (kernel
  panic in input thread at first touch event).
- CPU utilization is very high during that time (tested with thread analyser)
  and debug logs appear slowly

The LVGL display demos boot normally, but touch events are not generated at all
(no events with INPUT_EVENT_DUMP activated). CPU utilization seems normal.
Touch events work fine with the same sample on native_sim.

Any ideas what's going on here and where I could start searching?
